BeforeRender
============

Add a hook like before_filter to your controllers that gets executed between
when your action is completed and the template is rendered.  It can really
DRY up loading some data that is used for views (headers / layouts / etc).

Provided methods:
  before_render / before_render_filter / append_before_render_filter (aliases)
  prepend_before_render_filter

TODO
====

It doesn't have the skip_before_render_filter logic.

ActionController::Filters::FilterChain encodes logic about the types of filters
that exist all over the place where it could be more generic, maybe try to
merge some of this back into rails core.

Example
=======

class MyController < ApplicationController
  before_render :load_header_image_based_on_hostname

  private
  def load_header_image_based_on_hostname
    @header_image = HeaderImage.src_for_request(request)
  end
end

# in the layout or view
<img src="<%= @header_image %>" alt="header image" />
