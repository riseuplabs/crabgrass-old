= Multilingual Support in Crabgrass

== Enable Localized User Interface

All crabgrass localizations are stored in RAILS_ROOT/config/locales/*.yml. The
name of the file is the code of the language. These localizations
will not appear for the user until they are enabled in the database.

To do this, edit this file, removing any languages you don't
want supported:

  config/db/languages.yml

Then run this command:

  rake cg:load_default_data RAILS_ENV=production

This will populate the languages table in the database. Now the files
in config/locales/*.yml will get picked up.

== Get multi-byte character encoding to work

In order to store multibyte unicode, run this:

  rake cg:convert_to_unicode RAILS_ENV=production

Now you should be able to store arabic, chinese, hebrew, etc.
This task only works with mysql. You should only have to do this once.

== Editing crabgrass UI translations

You can edit the UI translations in crabgrass using the translator plugin.
