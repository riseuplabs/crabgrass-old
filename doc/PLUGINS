= Crabgrass Plugins

Crabgrass has a plugin system that is the reverse of the Ruby on Rails
plugin system: normally, rails plugins provide behavior for an
application that the plugin knows nothing about.

With crabgrass, however, crabgrass plugins know about crabgrass and
only work for crabgrass. The crabgrass plugin system is based on
customizations to {Rails Engines}[http://rails-engines.org]. Thus all
the {Rails Engines docs}[http://api.rails-engines.org] apply to
crabgrass plugins.

Normal rails engines load the plugin code first, then the application
code is loaded. This allows the application to override the plugin.
For crabgrass, we want the opposite: the plugin should override the
application.

Additionally, crabgrass has view listeners: plugins can add themselves
as listeners to certain hooks within the view code of the main
application. This allows a plugin to add custom view elements at just
the right spot without needing to override the entire view.

== Mods and Tools

Crabgrass has two types of crabgrass specific plugins: Mods and Tools.

Tools are exclusively for creating new page types. For example, the
WikiPage is a tool in <tt>tools/wiki_tool</tt>. All tools live in the directory
<tt>tools</tt>.

Mods have the added ability to replace the views in <tt>app/views</tt> with
the views in <tt>mods/modname/app/views</tt>. Modes live in the directory
<tt>mods</tt>. Mods directly modify the behavior of crabgrass.

Mods[link:files/doc/MODS.html] and Tools[link:files/doc/TOOLS.html]
have their own documentation files with information specific to each
one of them.

== Creating a Mod or Tool

Every crabgrass mod/tool starts out life as a regular plugin. To
create a skeleton:

  ./script/generate plugin your_plugin_name

This will create a new plugin in your vendor/plugins directory.

Move this directory to mods or tools directory:

  mv vendor/plugin/your_plugin_name mods

The first thing to do is edit the init.rb file. Adding:

  self.load_once = false

will make it so that in development mode the plugin is not only loaded
once. Without this, you need to restart rails each time you modify a
source file in the plugin.

Options specific to Mods ans Tools are listed on their respective
documentation.

As with every engine, mods and tools may contain an 'app' subfolder.
This app folder mirrors the app in the rails root. Files in the mod's
app will append or overwrite the files in the main app folder.

For example:

  app
  |-- controllers
  |   |-- account_controller.rb
  |   '-- application.rb
  '-- views
      '-- account
          |-- index.html.erb
          '-- login.html.erb
  mods
  |-- mymod1
  |-- mymod2
  '-- mymod3
      '-- app
          |-- controllers
          |   '-- account_controller.rb
          '-- views
              '-- account
                  '-- login.html.erb

The file <tt>mods/mymod3/app/views/account/login.html.erb</tt> will
*override* <tt>app/views/account/login.html.erb</tt> (but only if
<tt>override_views</tt> is set to true). The file
<tt>mods/mymod3/app/controllers/account_controller.rb</tt> will add new
methods or change existing methods of
<tt>app/controllers/account_controller.rb</tt>.

== Finalize

Another thing that mods can do is to run some code after everything
else has been run. This is not so useful for plugins, but for mods it
is often needed: Suppose, for example, you want to extend the Page
class. Normally, plugins are not written to know anything about your
particular rails application, but in the case of mods they are
intended to modify a very specific rails application.

If we were to try to modify the Page class in the init.rb of our mod,
we would create many errors trying to reference Page too early in
rail's startup process.

To get around this, mods can pass a block to self.finalize and this
code will only get called once everything is loaded. 

For example:

mods/mymode/init.rb:
  self.finalize do
    Page.class_eval do
      acts_as_rateable
    end
  end

== Plugin Migrations

If your plugin requires database migrations, you can generate new
migrations and put them in a db/migrate folder in the plugin.

Then, to add these migrations to the main rails app, you run this:

  ./script/generate plugin_migration

That will generate a new app level migration that will run your plugin
migrations.

== Adding Assets To A Plugin

The engines plugin makes it trivial to share public assets using
plugins. To do this, include an "assets" directory within your plugin,
and put your javascripts, stylesheets and images in subdirectories of
that folder:

  my_plugin
    |- init.rb
    |- lib/
    |- assets/
         |- javascripts/
         |    |- my_functions.js
         |
         |- stylesheets/
         |    |- my_styles.css
         |
         |- images/
              |- my_face.jpg

Files within the "asset" structure are automatically mirrored into a
publicly-accessible folder each time your application starts (ie
<tt>app/public/plugin_assets/<plugin name>/</tt>).

== Using Plugin Assets in Views

It's also simple to use Rails' helpers in your views to use plugin
assets. The default helper methods have been enhanced by the engines
plugin to accept a :plugin option, indicating the plugin containing
the desired asset.

For example, it's easy to use plugin assets in your layouts:

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "my_styles", :plugin => "my_plugin", :media => "screen" %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "my_functions", :plugin => "my_plugin" %>
 
... and similarly in views and partials, it's easy to use plugin images:

  <%= image_tag "my_face", :plugin => "my_plugin" %>
  <!-- or -->
  <%= image_path "my_face", :plugin => "my_plugin" %>

Where the default helpers allow the specification of more than one
file (i.e. the javascript and stylesheet helpers), you can do
similarly for multiple assets from within a single plugin.

This methods support this :plugin argument:

* stylesheet_link_tag
* javascript_include_tag
* image_path
* image_tag

Each one of these methods now accepts the key/value pair :plugin =>
"plugin_name", which can be used to specify the originating plugin for
any assets.

== Configuration

Mods may be enabled or disabled by editing <tt>config/mods_enabled.list</tt>.
Likewise for tools with <tt>config/tools_enabled.list</tt>.

Additionally, your mod may need extra routes. An example might be:

config/routes.rb:
  map.from_plugin :gibberize

See the mod README to find out if a routes entry is required.

Tools can be made visible or hidden on a per site basis. See
<tt>config/sites.yml</tt> and <tt>config/development.sites.yml</tt>.

== Running Tests

Run all tool tests:

  rake test:tools:all

To run the test for a particular tool:

  rake test:tools:all TOOL=gallery_tool

Instead of 'all', you can also specify 'functionals', 'integration',
or 'units'.

Mods tests can be runned the same way. Just change 'tools' to 'mods'
and 'TOOL' to 'MODS' on the rake command line.

== Writing Tests

Example:

  require 'test/unit'
  # Add your module file here
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../lib/meta_tag_helper'

  class MetaTagTest < Test::Unit::TestCase

    # Explicitly include the module
    include MetaTagHelper

    def test_end_html_tag
      assert_equal "</html>", end_html_tag
    end
  end
