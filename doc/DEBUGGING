= Some tips for debugging in crabgrass

== General Testing Tips

You can run a single test at a time like so:

  ruby test/unit/user_test.rb --name test_user_name

When you do this, ruby is run with the debugger on. You can put 'debugger'
lines in you code and it will stop on the line. Normally, this is only true
if you run rdebug. 

You can replace --name with -n


== Using INFO environment variable

sometimes, it is much more useful to use print for debugging than
to step through with a debugger.

to enable the printing of the 'info()' messages, define the INFO
environment variable:

  INFO=1 ruby test/unit/user_test.rb

  INFO=0 rake test:units

  INFO=3 script/server

The info level determines how much is shown:

  0 -- only high level stuff
  1 -- more detail
  2 -- even more detail
       and so on...
 
== Stopping on a SQL query

have you ever wanted to know what part of your code was triggering a particular
sql query? set the STOP_ON_SQL environment variable to find out.

For example:

  export STOP_ON_SQL='SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE (`users`.`id` = 633)'
  script/server -u

This will drop you into the debugger whenever that query occurs.

== Debugging View Tests

You can use the method "response_body" to get an easier to read version of the
response body. Super useful!
